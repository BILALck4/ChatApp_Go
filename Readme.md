# Chat Application

## Introduction

This project is a chat application developed to enhance my familiarity with the Go programming language and strengthen my web development skills. The objective is to explore backend development with Go and efficiently handle real-time communication using WebSockets.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Simple user login system with JWT token authentication.
- **Real-time Communication:** Users can send and receive messages instantly.
- **Frontend:** Developed using React with Material UI for enhanced design.
- **Backend:** Built with Go for efficient and scalable server-side operations.
- **WebSocket Integration:** Seamless real-time communication between users.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- React
- Material UI (MUI) for UI components

### Backend

- Go (Golang)
- Gorilla WebSocket package for WebSocket management
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication

### Tools

- Git for version control
